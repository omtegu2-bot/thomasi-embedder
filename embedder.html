  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This embedder started simple, now with history, quick links, and a settings menu. Ask Omtegu if you need help or have suggestions. 
   This will link back here on the correct page, original project: REMOVED The Thomasi Embedder.
  </p>
  <h2>List of Links</h2>
  <p>Save these alternate links for the site for later, they'll be kept up as long as possible, you can use them if your school blocks one</p>
  <p>https://tinyurl.com/h4zhkjmu - Links to google Appscript</p>
  <p>omtegu.neocities.org</p>
  <p>https://omtegu.codeberg.page/ - may be unstable or not even work</p>
  <p>lkarch.org/omtegu - Use with caution, the source of the whole site, if your school blocks this it could block ALL links</p>
  <p>https://omtegu2-bot.github.io/thomasi-embedder/ - Source of the site also has a page</p>
  <p>https://98555c13.thomas-dya.pages.dev/ - might work eventually </p>

  <h2>Update History</h2>
      <p>First, you should understand how the site originated, I had entered a public school for the first time Mid-October 2024 and I met with people, soon I saw people mildly frustrated at games getting blocked every day or so, so I made a manually edited HTML file that let you change what you were embedding.</p>
      <p>After awhile, they finally blocked HTML sometime around January 2025, I briefly used W3Schools try it editor, but eventually was like "What about that codepen.io I used when I was 9" and I was right as you could tell. </p>
      <p>Released on Feb 2nd, 2025 - Only a URL entry bar, a load button and fullscreen, lightmode is most accurate to this but no effects existed.</p>
      <p>Eventually after several people knew about it some kids in my History class started using it and I thought that was the end, around Spring 2025?</p>
      <p>I thought it was gonna be blocked but it wasn't, I was surprised, I thought it would be blocked September 2025 but it just kept going.</p>
      <p>An update on September 31st(?) 2025 adds in Quicklinks, styles, settings, and an overall UI update, please contact Omtegu if you know the exact date. Made only because Xander stole my code.</p>
  <p>An update on December 6th 2025 rounds a lot of borders and adds colorcoding to quicklinks, named V1.2.</p>
    <p>Another update named V1.2.1 adds in a new text header that can be modified, and drop shadows on things, along with adding the first 3 Metroid games! - Dec 9th 2025.</p>
      <p>Update 1.2.2 came out later on Dec 9th 2025 fixing rendering of Dark Purple and Dark mode!</p>
      <p>Update 1.2.2.1 came out later that day as well, on December 9th 2025 as well, adding a glow effect on hover. Alongside adding some fancy effects in some other menus.</p>
      <p>Update 1.3 came out on December 10th around 8:30AM. Adding many more effects to the site and reorganizing the layout. Updates continued to release throughout the day to add more effects and layout changes to optimize appearance. An update later that night added a (buggy) low performance mode.</p>
  <p>ඞ</p>
  <h3>Dark Day - Dec 12th 2025</h3>
    <p>Around 12:05PM, the codepen was blocked. Now this may seem bad, but treat it as good. Poor programming practices could be fixed. And the site would live anew.</p>
    <p>On Dec 15th, a search engine was made, and an attempt to release on lkarch.org/omtegu happened, school blocked within an hour, but the reason was known: About:Blank injection. The site loaded from a trig front page but opened in about blank, this was like a flare in the dark to GoGuardian.</p>
    <p>Tech support here very hyped to report at 12:01AM on December 16th 2025, holy shit I did it, it's done, Google Appscript, check it here if you somehow got another URL, https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx02NlNKV4_hs1GuFtbVyl_W6s6mGYpq6iCUo2VsR2ftjw_C284c_tin96OVpnchdDt9A/exec holy shit. Excuse my language but I think, I just THINK they'll have a hell of a time blocking this.</p>
     <p>Jan 4th 11:25PM a minor update to the iframe syntax was made</p>
      <p>Jan 6th 2026 added a featured section for games and switched the backend and fixed coloration. Added better Celeste and Hollow Knight.</p>
      <p>Jan 16th 2026 added in Betalabs with a CSS redesign avaliable</p>
      <p>Jan 20th 2026 added the cover page to beta labs, allowing covering up the main page with whatever you want!</p>
     <p>Jan 21st 2026 fixed cover page to only use 90% of the screen, click the bottom to leave. Good update to make things work.</p>
     </p></p><h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>Soon an ALEKS mode will be added, a keybind will open an ALEKS-like screen that will be (marginally) interactable. This is no longer relevant and may be removed</p>
  <p>Account system may be added in the future to allow you to see other online "friends" and they can see the link you're on.</p>
  <p>Achivement system will be added, loading certain sites, visting an amount of sites, having enough hours, and finding easter eggs will give achivements, which will unlock new themes and fonts.</p>
  <p>Always expanding CSS effects.</p>

    <h3>Credits</h3>
    <p>Made by Omtegu</p>
   <p>Favicon by https://www.youtube.com/@Ok2create</p>
   <p>Honestly gotta thank my IT Department for not blocking the first site for 313 days or 10433.33% longer than the average 3 days. Codepen was peak.</p>
   <p>lkarch as our webhost, Google Appscript just embeds a page on his site</p>
   <p>El Corto</p>
       <p>Thanks to Caleb/Himespider for many of the games, if not most.</p>
    <p>If somebody can research and mention any facts about New Nameful to me... go ahead, I'll add something for you in the credits.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This embedder was created for educational practices, the bookmark function does not work fully presently. You can set the bookmarks but not see the bookmark properly, it will load though.</p>
    <p>Also, changing style to anything but light will lead to quicklink text rendering wrong. - FIXED AS OF DEC 9TH!
